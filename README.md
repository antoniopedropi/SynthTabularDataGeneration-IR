# SynthTabularDataGeneration-IR

**SynthTabularDataGeneration-IR** is a research-oriented repository for evaluating synthetic data generation techniques tailored to **imbalanced regression** tasks over tabular datasets. It includes various oversampling strategies, learner models, custom metrics, and statistical analysis tools to benchmark performance across multiple datasets.

---

## Motivation

Handling underrepresented regions in regression target distributions is a well-known challenge. This repository provides implementations for:

- Classical resampling (e.g., Random Undersampling/Oversampling)
- SMOTE-based and relevance-aware strategies (e.g., SMOGN, WERCS, WSMOTER)
- Advanced techniques including:
  - **DAVID** (VAE-based)
  - **GenCART-IR** (CART-based synthetic generation with relevance and density adaptation) - originally proposed

It also supports custom evaluation metrics to better reflect performance on rare target regions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoniopedropi/SynthTabularDataGeneration-IR.git
cd SynthTabularDataGeneration-IR
```

2. Run main script:

```bash
python automated_script_datasets_final.py
```


## Output Files

All results are saved to the `results/` directory:

- Metric tables: RMSE, RW-RMSE, SERA
- Runtime benchmarks
- Wilcoxon test plots
- Summary tables of best-performing strategies

---

## Supported Metrics

Implemented custom metrics include:

- Relevance-weighted MSE / RMSE / MAE / R²
- SERA (Squared Error Residuals Area)

These help assess model performance especially on rare/extreme target values.
